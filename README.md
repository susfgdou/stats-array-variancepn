## Overview
This repository, **stats-array-variancepn**, provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the variance of an array using a two-pass algorithm. Variance is a statistical measurement that describes the spread of numbers in a data set. This project is designed for those who need to perform statistical analysis in JavaScript.

## Features
- Two-pass algorithm for accurate variance calculation.
- Lightweight and efficient implementation.
- Easy integration with existing JavaScript projects.
- Support for Node.js and browser environments.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/susfgdou/stats-array-variancepn.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd stats-array-variancepn
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
To calculate the variance of an array, import the function and pass your array as an argument. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```javascript
const { calculateVariance } = require('./variance');

const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const variance = calculateVariance(data);
console.log(`Variance: ${variance}`);
```

For detailed usage, refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/susfgdou/stats-array-variancepn/releases) section for downloadable files.

## How It Works
The two-pass algorithm involves two main steps:

1. **Calculate the Mean**: First, we find the average of the numbers in the array.
2. **Calculate the Variance**: Next, we use the mean to calculate the variance by averaging the squared differences from the mean.

This method ensures accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for larger datasets.

## Examples
Here are a few examples to illustrate how the variance calculation works:

### Example 1: Basic Calculation
```javascript
const data1 = [10, 12, 23, 23, 16, 23, 21, 16];
const variance1 = calculateVariance(data1);
console.log(`Variance of data1: ${variance1}`);
```

### Example 2: Empty Array
```javascript
const data2 = [];
const variance2 = calculateVariance(data2);
console.log(`Variance of data2: ${variance2}`); // Should handle gracefully
```

### Example 3: Negative Numbers
```javascript
const data3 = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5];
const variance3 = calculateVariance(data3);
console.log(`Variance of data3: ${variance3}`);
```

## API Reference
### `calculateVariance(array)`
Calculates the variance of the given array.

**Parameters**
- `array` (Array): An array of numbers.

**Returns**
- `number`: The variance of the array.
